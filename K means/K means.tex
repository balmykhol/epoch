%%\boldmath
%In this letter, an algorithm for evaluating the exact analytical bit error rate  (BER)  for the piecewise linear (PL) combiner for  multiple relays is presented. Previous results were available only for upto three relays. The algorithm is unique in the sense that  the actual mathematical expressions, that are prohibitively large, need not be explicitly obtained. The diversity gain due to multiple relays is shown through plots of the analytical BER, well supported by simulations.

% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway.
% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.

\textbf{Introduction}
\end{center}
\indent Unsupervised Machine Learning learning is the process of teaching a computer to use unlabelled, unclassified data and enabling the algorithm to operate on that data without supervision. Without any previous data training, the machine's job in this case is to organize unsorted data according to parallels, patterns, and variations. \\
\indent  K-means is a technique for data clustering that may be used for unsupervised machine learning. It is capable of classifying unlabelled data into a predetermined number of clusters based on similarities (K).\\
\indent The K-means clustering algorithm computes centroids and repeats until the optimal centroid is found. It is presumptively known how many clusters there are. It is also known as the flat clustering algorithm. The number of clusters found from data by the method is denoted by the letter 'K' in K-means.
\begin{center}
\textbf{Implementation}
\end{center}
It is suggested to normalize the data while dealing with clustering algorithms such as K-Means since such algorithms employ distance-based measurement to identify the similarity between data points.\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item We need to provide the number of clusters, K, that need to be generated by this algorithm.
\item Next, choose K data points at random and assign each to a cluster. Briefly, categorize the data based on the number of data points.
\item The cluster centroids will now be computed.
\item Iterate the steps below until we find the ideal centroid, which is the assigning of data points to clusters that do not vary.\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{kmeans.png}\\
\newpage
a) The sum of squared distances between data points and centroids would be calculated first.\\
\indent b) At this point, we need to allocate each data point to the cluster that is closest to the others (centroid).\\
\indent c) Finally, compute the centroids for the clusters by averaging all of the cluster's data points.
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{kmeans2.png}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
\textbf{Choosing the optimal K}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Elbow Method: In this method, we plot the WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Square)against different values of the K, and we select the value of K at the elbow point in the graph, i.e., after which the value of WSCC remains constant (parallel to the x-axis).
\item Silhouette method: In this method, we calculate the silhouette coefficient of each data point. The silhouette coefficient measures how well the data point fits in the assigned cluster as compared to the other cluster. The average Silhouette coefficient for different K is calculated to find the optimal value of K with the highest coefficient value.
\item Gap statistic method: In this method, we compare the WCSS for different values of K with the expected sum of squares values randomly generated from a uniform distribution. The optimal value of K is the one with the largest gap between the observed and expected sum of squares.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\textbf{Conclusion}
\end{center}
K-means clustering is a widely used approach for clustering. Generally, practitioners begin by learning about the architecture of the dataset. K-means clusters data points into unique, non-overlapping groupings. It works very well when the clusters have a spherical form. However, it suffers from the fact that clusters geometric forms depart from spherical shapes.\\
\indent Additionally, it does not learn the number of clusters from the data and needs that it be stated beforehand.
